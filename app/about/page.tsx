            i am a creator exploring the emotions we bury. <br></br>
            guilt. shame. wanting too much. not saying what we mean.


          </p>
            i work across illustration, comics, and interactive media.
            i used to build machine learning systems; now i build stories.
            most of my work lives somewhere between coming-of-age, connection, and the way technology reshapes who we think we are.

            i care about things that are tender, curious, and hard to look at.
